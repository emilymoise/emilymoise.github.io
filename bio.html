	<h1> Emily Moise - Bio </h1>

	<h2> 	Originally, I am from Dallas, TX. I moved from Dallas to Boston to start school at Tufts University in August 2016. Currently in my sophomore year, I am planning to major in Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Science. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.70/4.0. At Tufts, I am involved in Wind Ensemble, I am a captain of the Club Volleyball team, a volunteer for Girls of Code, and a member of Kappa Alpha Theta. Outside of school activites, I enjoy playing my bassoon, working out, and attending various types of athletic classes. </h2>
