	<h1> Emily Moise - Bio </h1>

	<p> I was born and raised in the Lake Highlands community of Dallas, TX. Growing up, I was interested in a wide array of activities. I competed in multiple sports, including: soccer, softball, basketball, and volleyball, while also playing the piano and bassoon. In high school, I continued with volleyball and bassoon, while keeping my first priority on my school work. Academically, I took and passed 12 AP tests, doing the best in the math and science subjects. </p>
	<p> In fall 2016, I moved from Dallas to Boston to start school at Tufts University. Currently in my sophomore year, I am planning to major in Electrical Engineering and minor in Computer Science. I have a cumulative GPA of 3.70/4.0. At Tufts, I am involved in Wind Ensemble, I am a captain of the Club Volleyball team, I am a volunteer for Girls of Code, and I am a member of Kappa Alpha Theta. </p>
